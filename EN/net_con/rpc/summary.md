# 1.1 Overview

The RPC service remotely calls stable interfaces with open codes to the business level. But on the lower layer, it supports request sending through multiple channels such as HTTP, HTTPS, SPDY and Socket.  It has the following features:

* The client calling codes are generated by tools automatically. The client does not need to care about the network communication protocols and the data formats used. 
* The returned data from the server will be inversely solved to Objective-C objects automatically, with no additional coding required. 
* RPC service provides optimization of data compression, cache and batch calling, and supports multi-lingual requests. 
* Unified RPC exception processing, such as dialog box pop-ups and toasts. 
* RPC supports RPC interceptors to achieve customized requests and processing. 
* It is signature-verification-enabled.
