## 1.1 Introduction

The client monitoring and log reporting are an indispensable part of the best wireless applications.  The client monitoring logs are always crucial for analyzing and solving issues. 

The mPaaS client monitoring system offers a wide variety of monitoring means and log categories, covering crashes, networks, storage, threads, memory, user behaviors, etc.  The matched background is capable of handling reporting of massive user data, and isolating valuable data from the massive data.  The developer can have an intuitive view of such data on the primary site.

### 1.2.1 Data statistics and trend analysis
It offers the statistics on the installed base, UV, PV, and version updates of applications, and analyzes user habits on the application in different regions and time periods, so as to provide reliable data support for developers. 

### 1.2.2 Public opinion monitoring
It keeps a watchful eye on feedbacks to the application in media, micro blogs or other channels, and identifies issues as early as possible.  (This feature is still under development.)

### 1.2.3 Monitor point and automatic monitor point
With manual or automatic monitor points by the developer, the run status of applications can be captured for reconstruction of the problematical scenes to the greatest extent.  In addition to the most basic monitor point, monitor points for the application memory, threads, traffic, startup time, and other performance indicators will also be set automatically.
